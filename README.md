# Pokemon Case Study ⚡️⚡️

This is an independent final project I've performed for BDI 475 - Introduction to Data Analytics Applications in Business.

I chose this dataset because I wanted to understand the complexities of why each Pokemon has vary degree of stats relative to their type, generation, and considering if they have a second attribute type 2.
